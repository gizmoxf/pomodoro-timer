Pomodoro Timer through Bash Scripting

This is a simple pomodoro timer made using bash script.

To use this make sure that the script has executable permissions by running
`chmod+x pomodoro.sh`

Once done, run the script by using the following:
`./pomodoro.sh <number of pomodoro>

Example
`./pomodoro.sh 4`

It would generate 4 pomodoros (25 minutes)  with 3 short breaks (5 minutes) and 1 long break (15 minutes)
